<h2>Requirements</h2></br>
The application requires the user to enter the customer name, the number of months for membership,</br>and yes or no to indicate whether the customer receives a special offer or not. The special offer gives customers a 15% discount of the membership no matter how many months they register.</br>
Each member will have discount depending on the months, therefore, 1–6 months will cost $30.0 per month, 7–12 months will cost $27.5 per month and more than 12 months will cost $25.0 accordingly.</br>
If they have a special offer, the total amount of cost will have 15% discount.</br>
5 members can be put.</br>
Makes a calculation membership and displays the result. The program should be kept running with entering next set of input data.</br>
After all sets of input data are entered,</br> the program will also display the information that includes the customer spending most, the customer spending least as well as a simple chart to display how many members with the number of months are less than 6 months or 6 months and greater than 6 months.</br>

<h2>Dealing With Error Validation</h2></br>
The application should be user-friendly by displaying appropriate welcome, exit and error message. </br>Your program should be run as normal without changing any source code except setting M with a different value.</br>
The member can register 1~60 months. An error message should be issued if a user enters a value beyond the range and the re-entering is required.</br>
An error message should be issued if the user enters something else other than yes or no for the special offer and the re-entering is required.</br>
